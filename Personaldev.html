                    <p>
                        I have always been told to slow down as a child and that slow and steady wins the race, therefore I guess that
                        allowed me to win a few races. Being patient allows me to see and grasp what is going on at any given time. By
                        doing so, I am able to examine the current scenario without missing important information that is being shown or
                        said. Being patient allows me to face challenging situations with calm and understanding rather of reacting
                        impulsively or frustratedly. I have more time to think, analyze information, and make more educated decisions
                        now that I have this skill.

                        I'm not sure why, but I've always been willing to assist others. This feature of mine has been with me for as
                        long as I can remember, and it has given me a sense of optimism. It has enabled me to establish deep bonds of
                        trust and understanding with my family, friends, and colleagues. The idea that I added a little joy to someone's
                        life, no matter how small, gives me a sense of fulfillment. Compassion can often appear to be a win-win situation 
                        because both me and the person receiving the kindness are happy and cheerful. I think I'm too nice, yet it doesn't
                        matter since I can brighten someone's day.

                    <p>
                        My ability to adapt has helped me handle unforeseen circumstances. The fact that I am changing how I approach a
                        specific circumstance has helped me come up with fresh answers to issues. This has helped me to reduce stress and
                        come up with solutions for challenging and unpleasant circumstances. My ability to adapt has kept me alert and
                        enabled me to reduce the number of mistakes I could make in order to offer a more appropriate result or response
                        to the issue at hand.

                    <p>
                        I've spent my entire life wandering aimlessly, going with the flow. Applying what I've learned to my life will be
                        difficult, but it shouldn't be impossible. I was never one to set goals; I didn't even have one to begin with, let
                        alone try to achieve them. After reading the specified chapters, it has opened my eyes to how much time I had been
                        wasting doing meaningless things instead of dreaming big and planning out the direction of my life. I think the best
                        way to apply the knowledge I've gained from the chapters I've read is to dream, set realistic goals that are micro,
                        short, mid, or long term. Determine who in my life is attempting to either help or hinder me from achieving the goals
                        that I have set for myself. On page 54, it is stated that every day has many opportunities, but the best opportunity
                        is the one that aligns with all of my goals, so I'll use the free opportunities that I have in the day to find a way
                        to move a step closer to achieving my goals. This book has opened my eyes, and I'll do my best to plan my own life
                        rather than allowing someone else to plan it for me, because I want to accomplish something great with my life rather
                        than being someone else's stepping stone.
