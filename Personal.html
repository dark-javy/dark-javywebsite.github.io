                                                    <p>
                                                        The most successful people in this world recognize that taking chances to get what they want is much
                                                        more productive than sitting around being too scared to take a shot.

                                Wake up to <strong>reality!</strong> Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.
                                The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are
                                merely <em> pain, suffering and futility</em>. Listen.... everywhere you look in this world, wherever
                                there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors,
                                the <em>vanquished</em> will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates war
                                and <em>hatred</em> is born in order to protect <em>love</em>. There are nexuses causal relationships that cannot
                                be separated. I want to sever the fate of this world. A world of only <em>victors</em>. A world of only <em>Peace</em>.
                                A world of only <em>Love</em>. <em><strong>I will create such a World</strong></em>. I am... the Ghost of the
                                <em>Uchiha</em>. For truly this reality... is a <em>hell</em>.

                                In this world, nothing perfect exists. It may be a cliche, after all, but it's the way things are.
                                That's precisely why ordinary men pursued the concept of perfection. It's infatuation. But ultimately
                                I have to ask myself, What is the true meaning of being perfect? And the answer I came up with was
                                nothing. Not one thing. The truth of the matter is, I despise perfection. If something is truly perfect,
                                that's it. The bottom line becomes there is no room for imagination, no space for intelligence or ability
                                or improvement. Do you understand two men of science like us? Perfection is a dead end. A condition of
                                hopelessness always strive to be better than anything that came before you. But not perfect. Scientists
                                agonize over the attempt to achieve perfection. That's the kind of creatures we are. We take joy and trying
                                to exceed our grasp in trying to reach for something that in the end, we have to admit, may be, in fact,
                                impossible to reach. In other words, you may think we operate on the same level, but you are wrong the moment
                                you're started talking about perfection, you embraced an impossible concept and had already lost to me. That is,
                                of course, if you are indeed a scientist at all.

                    <p>
                        I think the Enneagram personality type 9 (Peacemaker) best describes me. As a result of my disposition, I am easygoing,
                        patient, and kind. I also try to avoid disagreement as much as possible in order to maintain a pleasant environment. To
                        sustain my relationships with others, their demands are more likely to take precedence over mine. Struggling to establish
                        myself has been a problem for me, and it also prevents me from taking action or making a decision. As a result of this,
                        I get a sensation that a desire or desires of mine may not have been fulfilled. These traits I am working hard to overcome,
                        however I still prefer to maintain a tranquil environment for my family and myself.
